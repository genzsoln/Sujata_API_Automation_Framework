				Another Way To Run the Framework

instead of writing EndPoints, Route class, we have to create on Properties file, inside that Properties we have to 
place all the URL's 

1  Create Properties file
	Go to Project
	Create properties file under src/test/resources
	Right click on src/test/resources,select new, file, provide the name routes.properties

Properties file :
	
Properties file is like normal text file, we are not follow any proper syntax here, we dont wont any java syntaxes
like duoble quotation, single quotation, or semicolon these things wont work, so we can just write plain data in the Properties file.
	
In Properties file "#" hash is a comment.

2  Create one File for UserEndPoints, copy UserEndPoints file from api.endpoints and paste it in same package & rename it by UserEndPoints2
   Design this end point to get the data from properties file.

We need to add one additonal method, which will load your properties file.
In java we have one class "Resource Bundle" is a special class which we have so by using that class we will able to 
loas properties file and we will ablle to read the data from the properties file

3 Create one class for UserTests2.java Copy paste UserTests.java in same package change the name.
for reading the data

4 go to testng.xml 
	add your class name there i.e UserTest2
	Run Your testng Suite
	
5  Execution
Run the test cases using testng.xml you can directly run but if you want to run your test 
cases remotely or through jenkins command prompt then we should able to run through ppm.xml

We need to add dependency/plugins in pom.xml
We need to add two different plugins.
We need to add these plugin before the dependencies.
1 Maven compiler plugin
2 Maven surefire plugin

1 Go to Chrome 
2 Search maven surefire plugin is rewuire to run our test case through pom.xml 
3 click on apache maven i.e maven.apache.org
4 Go to Usage
5 copy paste dependency/plugin in pom.xml
6 go to search maven compiler plugin
7 click on apache maven i.e maven.apache.org
8 Go to Usage
9 copy paste dependency/plugin in pom.xml
10 also we need to add   <build> <pluginManagement> tag before Plugin
11 In same plugin there is on comment 
 <!-- put your configurations here -->
 we need to add testng xml name 
 <suite>testng.xml</suite>
12 inside the configuration we need to add one more tag
	          <configuration>
            <!-- put your configurations here -->
            <suiteXmlFiles>
            <suiteXmlFile>testng.xml</suiteXmlFile>
			</suiteXmlFiles>
          </configuration>
we need to add above tag under the surefire plugin.
12 Save all the Plugin/dependency

Then run pom.xml

pom.xl is related to maven we have to run pom.xml file throght maven

How to run pom.xml

1  right click 
2  select run as
3  select maven test

Our all the test cases run successfully & it shows BUILD SUCCESS, it meand all our tests are successfully 
executed throught pom.xml.

	So the configuration whcih we have to do in the pom.xml so that we are able to run our test through pom.xml
	Also this is same process we have to follow when we use maven, for selenium, restassured 
	-- we need to add maven plugin
	-- specify the configuration

6  Run pom.xml Remotely
	we are running our test within our Eclipse locally
	But Suppose tomorrow i move this project to somewhere else i dont have an eclipse and without Eclipse also we shouls able to 
	run our project.
	
	We have to run our code through Jenkins , we are able to run our test in the remote environment that means through jenkins we will able to trigger
	
First of all we have to Check
1 Our scripts are working without having Eclipse.
2 Without using Eclipse can we run our scripts through command prompt 
3 we have to run this pom.xml through command prompt

In Eclipse we already have Maven Plug-in by default,
	we will get a maven plugin so that's the reason we are able to create maven project,
  	able to update pom.xml, 
	we are able to run pom.xml 
	
Whenever we want to run our project outside the Eclipse.
Then we need to install maven at the OS level that means if you are working on MAc or Window you have to download the maven software and we have to install it 
So, Maven is available in the two different Flavors
	1 Eclipse plugin
	2 Software in the OS system level we have to install on maven software
so we will able to run pom.xml in our command prompt

Steps:
1  Close your Eclipse
2  Install the Maven on Window
3  First download the software
4  Go to Chrome search Download Maven
5  Select Maven apache org, i.e download apache maven
6  As per your window select file for win select Binary zip archive "we need to do small configuration here"
7  Once download extrat that zip file 
8  After extracting copy this folder and patste it in c drive
9  Open the folder and set the path
10  click on folder open the bin folder & copy the above path
11 go to my pc , go to properties
12  go to advanced system settings
13  click on environment variable
14 select path variable and click on edit
15 click on new , paste the url click on ok, ok

Cross check maven configuration 
1  Open cmd
2  Write mvn -version
3  after running above command maven is added in your machine or not
4  Then we run the project through cmd

How to Run project on CMD
1  type cd "location of your file"
2  type dir 'it shows all project related files'
3  type mvn test (this will fetch all the pom.xml information)
4  Then it shows the result (if java version is not compatible error will be occured)
	Suppose if the error occured then add the tag in pom.xml inside the maven-compiler-plugin
	      <configuration>
				<source>10</source>
				<source>10</source>
          </configuration>
    As well as we need to add a java 12 or 13 or we need to install version which is above java 11
    Then need to set java environment variable
    type mvn test in cmd
    
Need to remember below points:

1 Execute tests using pom.xml within eclipse.
2 Execute tests using pom.xml in command prompt.
3 Commit code in local repository (Git repository)
4 Push your code to remote repo (GitHub repo)
5 Run project in Jenkins (From git github) (jenkins will get code from the latest code from the GitHub every time because this
 is everyday task whwnever you do some changes whatever you add new test cases or update / delete anything we will always make 
 sure those changes should be part of local repository & remote repo).

If we are executing successfully using maven command then only we will able to run our project remotely through Jenkins from Git.
we will able to run it because in Jenkins also we will specify the maven command.

-- Jenkins also run your project by taking the help og the same command.

What is CI (Continuous Integration) 

Continuous Integration process 
There are multiple dev and tester so developer , there are multiple developer are working on multiple things.
So, at the end of the day what they do is they checkin the code in the common tepository this repo is global repository.
But before sending the code to global repository they are also having their own local repositories this is call as a git, git is 
local repository.
So they will commit their code first inside the their local repositories and then they will push their entire code from their 
local repository to remote repository. 
Once the entire code is availale in the global repository this is Github Repository.
Git is local repository and GitHub is global repository.

Now devops team will do here is devops team will create "Build" by taking all this code build or package or what ever related to 
code, this we will validate by using testing code, so whatever developer is doing parallely the Testerd also do the same things.

So What ever automation code we have developed at the end of the day all the tester they will keep their code in their local 
repository which is git repository and from therre they will push the code in the GitHub repository & in the devops environment 
they will use the Maven to create a build from the developers and from the GitHub they will get the automation code using jenkins 
they will try to exit or automation code against the build.

So here it self basic sanity and regression is completed before getting the build. all this process called Continuous Integration 
process one side the developer will do their own tasks and other side thetester also will do their own tasks so developer's, 
tester's & devops these teams will work together collaboratively to achieve the one goal 

Why we need to run project so many times

Above is actual CI process that is the reason we should able to execute our project first in the command prompt before directly 
jumping into the Jenkins, in the local environment we are testing whether our project is successfully working fine or not.

So we need two verification
1 We should able to run our project within our eclipse
2 We should able to execute project within command prompt
Once they are successful then we will able to commit our code into Git
Then push it to the GitHub 
Then using Jenkins we will able to run our project All this is a complete process.
Then commit the code in the local repository


Git Installation:

Steps 1 : Install Git 

1  Go to The Chrome
2  Search Git bash
3  Click on first link i.e Download https://git-scm.com/downloads
4  click os Download as per your OS win, mac, linux
5  Go to Download in you system
6  Click on Git install the software just clicking next next.

After you install Git Bash, you can right-click inside a folder. You'll see an two options 'Open Git Bash' 'Open GIT GUI' 
When we open 'GIT Bash' then you will able to see the git command prompt. You can then type and run all different commands in that window.

Step 2 : We need GitHub Account.
-- Go to github.com
-- create an account with github.

Following are the commands we need to use

1  git init - create local repository in your project location

	Go to your project location
	Right click on any place
	select 'git bash'
	Git command prompt will be open
	After git init one folder will be created in your project location i.e 'git'
	
2  git config --global user.name "your name"
   git config --global user.email "abc@gmail.com"
   
	Once we create our local repository & we have to provide our information to the local repository.
	because 1st time when we're working with a git command first time we have to tell our username and email address
	to the git repository 
	Because whatever changes we do or whatever updations modifications you do everything well be remembered by suing our name anf mail address
	So we have to use these command
	only we have to use these 2 command when we use git first time.

3  git status

	we have to check the status like is there any files are ready to add or not every time we can check the status
	So whether files are there in the working directory or not, already commited already added or not already committes,pushed or not 
	We can verify by uing status commands.
	
	after this command it will shows how many files or what we need to add this files inside staging area.
	
4  git add -A

	If you want to add all the command into staging area.
	
   git add filename.jave
	
	If you want to add specific file the directly write the name of that files.
	
   git add .
   
   If you want to add multiple files with the same extension which are having same extension then we can write this simple regular expression * start 
   It means all the files which ever is having have extension will
